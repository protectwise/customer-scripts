ProtectWise Emitter configuration for ELK Integration

This folder includes a sample ProtectWise Emitter configuration file for use when integrating with Logstash.  This configuration assumes the Emitter is installed on the same device as Logstash, or at least Logstash has direct read access to the logstash.out file.
