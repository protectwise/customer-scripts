ProtectWise Deployment Scripts and Configurations

This project includes sample scripts and configuration files to assist with deployments.

    a startup script and a cloudformation template for a simple HA solution for the sensor instance in a VPC utilizing Route53
    APIs and an autoscaling group of 1 configuration. In the future sample scripts and Lambda functions will be added to address
    automated remediation. (e.g. quarantine an instance via security group change or shut down an instance.)

    configuration, and Kibana objects file with a dashboard, visualizations, and saved queries.
